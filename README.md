# Synchronisation in Coupled Oscillator Networks

Computational investigation of the Kuramoto model across different network topologies.

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python experiments.py
```

## Results
- Critical coupling: Kc ≈ 2.1 (full), 6.8 (ring)
- Size scaling: t_sync ∝ N^0.58
- Critical delay: τc ≈ 1.2s
