    ABSTRACT = {The Kuramoto model is a classical model used for the describing
                of synchronization in populations of oscillatory units. In the
                present paper we study the Kuramoto model with delay with a focus
                on the distribution of the oscillators’ frequencies. We consider
                a series of rational distributions which allow us to reduce the
                population dynamics to a set of several delay differential
                equations. We use the bifurcation analysis of these equations to
                study the transition from the asynchronous to synchronous state.
                We demonstrate that the form of the frequency distribution may
                play a substantial role in synchronization. In particular, for
                Lorentzian distribution the delay prevents synchronization, while
                for other distributions the delay can facilitate synchronization.
